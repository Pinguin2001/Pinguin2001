### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I love tinkering with Windows and all variants of it (MobileCore, ModernPC, etc.) as well as writing apps for the UWP and WinUI platform in C#.
Taking and editing photos is another hobby of mine, as well as dancing (what you probably didn't expect from a tech guy like me :p)

I also enjoy travelling and exploring different countries and learning languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on :
  - [Horizon](https://github.com/horizon-developers/browser) - a truly native Webbrowser for Windows 11
  - [Lexel](https://julianhasreiter.eu/projects/lexel) - a study project I work on with a friend

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning :
  - French (currently somewhere between B1 and B2)
  - JavaScript / TypeScript

- âš¡ Fun fact : I first got into tech at 3 yrs old on a Windows XP PC, which I later downgraded to Windows 95 for fun a few years later. The PC has a Pentium III, with 256MB of ram and a ~10 GB HDD.
